             README for NifLib 2 - NIFF runtime parser generator

1. What is it?

	It is a runtime parser generator capable of reading/editing/writing of
.nif (NetImmerse File Format) game state files.

1.1. Description

	It uses XML documents as formal languages what are used as .nif/.kf/.kfm
parser at runtime. You can find the documents here:
	- "nif.xml" -> https://github.com/amorilia/nifxml
	- "kfm.xml" -> https://github.com/amorilia/kfmxml
	It can be used to read/edit/write those documents.
	It can be used to read/edit/write file formats parsed by using those
documents.
	It has XML tag and attribute names and meaning hard-coded. It also has
a hard-coded mapping between tag "basic", attribute "niflibtype" value, and
"C++" types.
	"Field.BlockIndex" starts at -1 - <compound name="Header">. Then increases
with one with each block read from the .nif file. "Header" and "Footer" are
blocks of the .nif file not included in "Header.Num Blocks".
	Provides access to the .nif file structure as:
		- a list of fields - Compiler.FCount(), Compiler[]
		- a tree of lists of fields - Compiler.AsTree()

	The latest version can be found here:
