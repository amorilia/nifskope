             README for NifLib 2 - NIFF runtime parser generator

1. What is it?

	It is a runtime parser generator capable of reading/editing/writing of
.nif (NetImmerse File Format) game state files.

1.1. Description

	It uses XML documents as formal languages what are used as .nif/.kf/.kfm
parser at runtime. You can find the documents here:
	- "nif.xml" -> https://github.com/amorilia/nifxml
	- "kfm.xml" -> https://github.com/amorilia/kfmxml
	It can be used to read/edit/write those documents.
	It can be used to read/edit/write file formats parsed by using those
documents.
	It has XML tag and attribute names and meaning hard-coded. It also has
a hard-coded mapping between tag "basic", attribute "niflibtype" value, and
"C++" types.
	Provides access to the .nif file structure as:
		- a list of fields - Compiler.FCount(), Compiler[]
		- a tree of lists of fields - Compiler.AsTree()

	The latest version can be found here:
